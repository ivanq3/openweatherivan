# Openweathermap by Ivan M. - test assignment

This project lacks use of services and display of use case how it can be used (sorry for that). I was fullfilling the minimum requirements and some part of the code is as is and needs improvement. I will rework it, probably rewirte it from scratch with more features once I can dedicate more time to it. Angular Material is used for some basic styling and cities mat-card reordering. Angular router basic use case. 

Components:
 - WeatherCity - displays temperature by hour for selected city
 - WeatherList - displays list of 5 hardcoded cities (sry no search, adding or removing cities available at this time)
 -- Weatheritem - just styled looks for each city from WeatherList component

For the rest information take a look at this simple code.
 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.
Upgraded to version 10

## Development server

Make sure to run `npm install` before `ng serve`. 
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
Tests are missing at this point (an attempt was made), due to some issues I ran into and lack of time (and knowledge) to work on it and resolve the issue quickly.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
